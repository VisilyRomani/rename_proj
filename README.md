# Rename Project
This is a short python 3 script that I created to batch rename photos after editing in photoshop. 

## Requirements
- The files must start with DSC 
- The files will be set as JPEGs

## Usage
- There are two ways to rename either letter and number or number
- Set to 0 to exit
- Set to 1 to select the starting letter and then starting number to batch rename
- Set to 2 to select the starting number 
- This will start at the letter/number you choose and increment the number
